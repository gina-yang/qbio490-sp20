atac c1 and rna c1 GOOD
atac c3 and rna c4, c6 GOOD (combine rna c4 and c6 and map to atac c3)
atac c6 and c5 and rna c5 

RNA c5 = STEM CELL-LIKE CLUSTER
- Map atac cluster 6 to that
- Maybe also atac cluster 5 to that? transcription factors "Fstl1" "Postn"


atac missing c2, c4
rna missing c2, c3

Wnt signaling
CXCL14

Bmp signaling


Run with target genes in runexample



atac: no Wnt3, rep w/ Wnt7b
atac: missing Mmp7, Dkk1, deleted both



Reduce threshold
color clusters the same
more noise = more edges
